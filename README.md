#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective #Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1. Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering refers to engineering principles, methods, and tools to develop and maintain high-quality software systems.
IMPORTANCE
Enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.

2. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Developing operating systems (Windows, MacOS)
Web applications( Facebook, google)
mobile apps(Instagram,uber)

3. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planning: In this phase, the project goals, scope, and resources are defined
Requirements analysis: involves gathering and analyzing requirements for the software.
Design: Software architecture and design are formulated.
Implementation: Where the actual development of the software takes place.
Testing: Software undergoes thorough testing to identify and resolve any bugs or issues.
Deployment: Software is released into the production environment after successful testing.
Maintainance: It is maintained to address any issues.

4. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall relies heavily on thorough documentation. Requirements and design documents are detailed and finalized before development begins while Agile emphasizes working software over comprehensive documentation. communication is often direct and continuous. Waterfall can be appropriate when developing software for regulatory compliance where requirements are clearly defined by law.
Agile can be appropriate when developing a social media app where the features and design might change depending on the users feedback.

5. Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

SOFTWARE DEVELOPER
design and development: Are responsible for designing, coding, and implementing software applications
code review and debugging: identify and fix bugs
collaboration: work closely with other team members to ensure the software meets the project requirements.
Documentation: they document the code, including writing comments and creating technical documentation to help others understand and maintain the software.

QUALITY ASSURANCE ENGINEER(QA)
Testing and validation:
Automation
bug tracking 
quality standards
collaboration and communication

PROJECT MANAGER
project planning and coordination
team leadership
risk management
stakeholder communication
resource management 
quality and performance monitoring



6. Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each. 
IDES boosts developer productivity by integrating essential tools into a single platform, making coding, debugging, and project management more efficient. Examples are; visual studio code, eclipse, and IntelliJ idea
1. efficiency and productivity
Examples: visual studio code(VS code)
VCS  ensures code integrity, enables collaboration, tracks changes, and supports disaster recovery, making it indispensable for modern software development.
   examples: Git and subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
some various challenges include managing technical debt, keeping up with evolving technologies, handling complex requirements, debugging, time management, collaborating with cross-functional teams, and ensuring security and compliance.
Strategies to overcome these challenges include continuous learning, clear communication, regular meetings, risk assessment, and adherence to security best practices.

7. Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit: tests individual components (like functions or methods)in isolation to catch defects early and improve code quality.
2. Intergration: verifies that different modules work together correctly
3. system testing: Tests the entire software system as a whole in an environment resembling production, validating that the system meets functional and non-functional requirements.
4. Acceptance testing: often involving the end-users to ensure software meets business requirements
   Importance
risk mitigation: these testing types help prevent serious issues from reaching production.
Quality assurance: this testing contributes to the overall quality, ensuring the software is reliable, secure, and performs well under different conditions.
cost efficiency: Detecting and fixing defects early in the development process reduces the cost and effort required to address issues later on.
user satisfaction: Testing plays a crucial role in delivering a product that users will be satisfied with.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of formulating questions, providing context, and specifying constraints to help the model understand and respond effectively.
Importance: it is essential in maximizing the effectiveness of interactions with AI models, ensuring that responses are precise, relevant, and aligned with user intentions.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Tell me about technology
improved prompt: Explain the recent advancements in artificial intelligence and their potential impact on the healthcare industry
it clearly defines the scope of the request, it guides the AI to focus on specific advancements and their implications.ive.
